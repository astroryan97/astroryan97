Hi, I’m @astroryan97, I'm a graduate student at the University of Alberta in the astrophysics group. I previously did work in radio astronomy under Dr. Jeroen Stil with a focus on cosmic magnetism in extragalactic sources. My work has been presented at several conferences which include the 2021 virtual SKA Science Conference. I also had the honor to give the first ever student research colloquium at the University of Calgary on February of last year. My first research paper was published on March 8, 2019.

I’m interested in data science and all things astronomy!

My current interests include: 
- Machine learning techniques in astronomy,
- AGN and active galaxies, 
- cosmic magnetism,
- formation and evolution of galaxies, 
- stellar dynamics and evolution.

I also enjoy statistical analysis and machine learning. I have spent the past few years studing data science and analytics, with the intention of completing the Master's Degree in Data Science and Analytics or Computer Science. The areas of data science that interest me the most are:

- Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence.
- Data Mining and Statistical Analysis.
- Data visualization.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving machine learning and computational physics.
